<h1> What is TweetAround?</h1>

<h3> "TweetAround" is quite simply a Ruby on Rails application, which returns a map of markers with geotagged tweets corresponding to your query. It invokes <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search">Twitter Search API</a> and <a href="http://apneadiving.github.io/">GMaps4Rails</a> for locating tweets and displaying them. Notice that only one tweet is taken from each default city according to "most recent" tweets. <br> Many thanks to Michael Hartl's informative <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"> Ruby on Rails tutorial</a>. <br> </br> Source code can be found on <a href="http://github.com/chubchubcharles/tweetaround/">GitHub</a>.</h3>
